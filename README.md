📊 Football Player Data Analysis & Visualization

By Ashfaaq Feroz Muhammad (2023EBCS005)

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python, focusing on football player demographics, performance metrics, and market valuation.
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visual insights, and a comprehensive summary presented across 11 analytical tasks.

🚀 Project Overview

The analysis explores:
	•	Player age distribution
	•	Nationality dominance
	•	Relationship between age & performance
	•	Skill-based comparisons (dribbling, finishing, ball control)
	•	Club-wise performance strategies
	•	Potential vs. age comparison
	•	Outlier detection in release clauses
	•	Correlation between key performance metrics

All insights are supported by visualizations generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Pandas
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🧹 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The raw dataset contained mixed formats for currency, height, weight, and missing values.
Key preprocessing steps:
	•	Converted Wage and Value from formats like €565K, €100M into numeric values.
	•	Converted Height from feet/inches (e.g., 5'11") to centimeters.
	•	Converted Weight from lbs to kilograms.
	•	Removed invalid/missing entries where necessary.

✔ Ensured a clean, consistent, analysis-ready dataset.

📈 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (11 Tasks)

Task 1: Data Cleaning Output

Displayed cleaned numeric columns for verification.

Task 2: Age Distribution

Histogram + KDE showing most players between 20–30 years, peak at ~25.

Task 3: Top 10 Nationalities

England, Germany, Spain, and France dominate the dataset.

Task 4: Age vs Overall Rating

Younger players (18–25) show a wide range of ratings, while older players show fewer top ratings.

Task 5: Preferred Foot Comparison

Right-footed players show a slightly higher median overall rating.

Task 6: Correlation Heatmap

Strong correlations found between:
	•	Overall ↔ Wage
	•	Overall ↔ Value
	•	Potential ↔ Value
Also, younger players tend to have higher potential.

Task 7: Trend of Overall Across Age

Performance peaks between 27–30 before declining.

Task 8: Potential – Younger vs Older Players

Younger players (<25) show significantly higher potential scores.

Task 9: Top 5 Clubs Analysis

Visual comparison of Overall vs Potential indicating different talent strategies.

Task 10: Skill Ratings by Nationality

Brazil & Argentina excel in dribbling/ball control;
Germany & England score higher in finishing.

Task 11: Outlier Analysis (Release Clause)

Scatter + regression line shows:
	•	Higher overall → higher release clause
	•	Outliers reveal market dynamics, contract differences & undervalued players.

📊 Sample Visualizations

Here are some of the visual insights included in the project:
	•	Age Distribution Histogram
	•	Nationality Bar Chart
	•	Scatter Plot (Age vs Overall)
	•	Correlation Heatmap
	•	Potential Distribution by Age Group
	•	Release Clause Regression Plot

🧠 Key Insights
	•	Players peak around 27–30, both in performance and value.
	•	Younger players (<25) carry higher potential and market promise.
	•	Some clubs focus on seasoned talent, others on future potential.
	•	Nationality has a noticeable effect on skill type emphasis.
	•	Release clause outliers provide insight into market inefficiencies.
